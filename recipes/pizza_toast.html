    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple toast covered with melted cheese and toppings</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons of butter</li>
        <li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces of sliced mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 an ounce of sliced pepper jack cheese</li>
        <li>5 slices of pickled jalapeno</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 235 Fahrenheit or 135 Degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on both sides of each slice of bread and place on the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake, flipping once halfway through, until bread is lightly browned on both sides, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover the perimeter of one bread slice with half of the mozzarella cheese, leaving the middle part of the bread empty.</li>
        <li>Top with other slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Use the back of a spoon to make an indentation in the middle of the bread slices, pushing down firmly to reach the bottom slice.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce to the indentation, and sprinkle half the Italian seasoning over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover with remaining 1/2 ounce mozzarella cheese and pepper jack, followed by jalapeno and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Garnish with remaining Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Slice in half and serve.</li>
    </ol>
