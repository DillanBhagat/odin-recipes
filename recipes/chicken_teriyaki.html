    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, sake, rice vinegar, brown sugar in a bowl and whisk well until sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Stir in sesame seeds and crushed red pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oils in a large skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly over chicken. Add chicken in a single layer to the skillet and cook, undisturbed until chicken is browned and releases easily from the pan, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip chicken pieces, cook 1 more minute and remove from pan;set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add ginger and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Reserve 2 tablespoons of the green onions for garnish and add remaining green onions to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1 minute. Add 1 cup reserved soy sauce mixture to the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a boil and cook until sauce has reduced by about a third or until slightly thickened and glossy.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened slightly and chicken is coated in the sauce and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice and sprinkled with reserved green onions.</li>
    </ol>
