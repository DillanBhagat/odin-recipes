    <p>With a graham cracker crust, ultra-creamy filling, and a scrumptious fresh strawberry topping.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>14 graham crackers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons of butter melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounces) packages of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups of white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoons of salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Strawberry Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts fresh strawberries, stems removed and halved, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of cold water</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 Fahrenheit or 175 Degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Break graham crackers into a bowl of a food processor.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, and pulse until large crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just until combined and mixture resembles slightly wet sand.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture lightly into a bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325 Fahrenheit or 165 Degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Bring about 3 quarts of water to boil.</li>
        <li>PLace cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle attachment, whip cheese on a medium speed just until smooth, to avoid incorporating too much air.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Add in sour cream, vanilla, lemon juice and salt and blend until just combined.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low speed, add eggs, one at a time, mixing until each egg is fully incorporated, then mix until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a prepared crust. Wrap bottom and sides of the pan well with heavy duty aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place the pan inside a large roasting pan and set the pan in the oven.</li>
        <li>Carefully, pour boiling water into the roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water inside the foil or the cheesecake.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly, around 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully, remove pans from the oven and allow cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After about 10 minutes, just when the cheesecake starts to release itself from the sides, run a knife around the sides.</li>
        <li>Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Unwrap cheesecake and place in refrigerator until fully chilled and ready to serve, at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Place 1/2 of strawberries in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon, vanilla, cornstarch, and water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boi over high heat, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture to simmer until berries after softened.</li>
        <li>Using a potato masher, mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue to simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, stir in remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Serve cheesecake slices with strawberry topping.</li>
    </ol>
